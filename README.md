# CI/CD Static WebApp Deployment

This repo is a simple site used to learn more about deploying web applications to Microsoft Azure's Web App services. The proceeding sections contain more information about the free web template.

## Notes

- Because the code only uses html/css/js, the Azure Status Web App service is used
- Be sure to select "custom" from the *Build Presets* drop down box
- The *App Location* is simply "/" because that is where index.html resides
- More information is location in the [Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/get-started-portal?tabs=vanilla-javascript&pivots=github)
